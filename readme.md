## Template for a basic stereokit-rust program

### Download the source project then this template:
* git clone https://github.com/mvvvv/StereoKit-rust/
* git clone https://github.com/mvvvv/StereoKit-template/

First, check that you can launch the Stereokit-rust demos as described here https://github.com/mvvvv/StereoKit-rust/blob/master/README.md

Then, go to the Stereokit-template project.

### Run the template on your PC's headset :
* Make sure you have [OpenXR installed](https://www.khronos.org/openxr/) with an active runtine.
* Launch: `cargo run`

### Run the template on your PC using the [simulator](https://stereokit.net/Pages/Guides/Using-The-Simulator.html) 
* Launch: `cargo run  -- --test`

If you're using VsCode you'll see two launchers in launch.json to debug the template.


## Run the project's demo on your Android headset:
* Launch: `cargo apk run`
